Write a program that declares and populates a one-dimensional vector of 10000 elements in at least three different ways and measures which way is the most efficient.
1) vector<int> v;
    - for loop
    - push back
2) vector<int> v;
    -use the insert function for 10000 values
3) read integers from a data file;
4) vector<int> v(10000,2);
